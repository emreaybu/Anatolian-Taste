                <p>
                    Kebab is a traditional dish made with seasoned meat, usually lamb, beef, or chicken. The meat is marinated with a mixture of spices such as paprika, cumin, garlic, and black pepper, often combined with olive oil and yogurt to make it tender and flavorful. It is then grilled on skewers or cooked over an open flame. Kebab is typically served with rice, grilled vegetables, fresh salad, and flatbread. Some versions also include a rich tomato or yogurt-based sauce to enhance the taste.

                <p>
                    Pide is a traditional Turkish flatbread often referred to as "Turkish pizza" due to its shape and toppings. It is made from soft, yeast-based dough, shaped into an oval or boat form. The dough is topped with a variety of ingredients like seasoned minced meat (usually lamb or beef), cheese, vegetables, and spices such as paprika, cumin, and garlic. It is then baked in a hot stone oven until golden and crispy on the edges, with tender, juicy toppings. Pide is typically served hot, sliced, and can be enjoyed with a variety of sides.

                <p>
                    Lahmacun is a delicious Turkish dish, often called "Turkish flatbread" or "Turkish pizza," but unlike pide, it has a thinner crust. The base is topped with a mixture of minced meat (typically lamb or beef), finely chopped onions, garlic, tomatoes, parsley, and spices such as cumin, paprika, and red pepper flakes. Once topped, it is baked until crispy and slightly charred at the edges. Lahmacun is usually served with fresh parsley, a squeeze of lemon, and sometimes a drizzle of olive oil. It's often rolled up and eaten as a quick, flavorful snack.
